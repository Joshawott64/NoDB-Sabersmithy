# NoDB Sabersmithy

Sabersmithy allows users to create, edit, and delete their own lightsaber objects.

Current features include:

- The 'Forge' where users build their saber by clicking on which components they wish to use. A preview image of their saber is rendered in real time via state values.
- The 'Gallery' where users can view a table containing their sabers along with a few sabers the program creates by default.
  - Each row in the gallery table has an 'Edit' and 'Delete' button (disabled for default sabers)
  - The 'Edit' button renders a similar interface as 'Forge' and saves changes made to the given saber.
  - The 'Delete' removes the given saber.
